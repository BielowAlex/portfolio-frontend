          Hello, iâ€™m Alex!
          <br />
          <br />
          I am a Junior JavaScript Developer with 3 years of commercial
          experience, during which I actively worked on various projects,
          including startups and web services, using ReactJS, NextJS, and
          NestJS. I have practical experience with PostgreSQL and AWS, as well
          as integrating payment systems and authorization services. I am
          distinguished by my ability to learn quickly, my skill in solving
          complex problems, and my effectiveness in communicating with both the
          team and clients.
          <br />
          <br />I am noted for my leadership skills, having successfully managed
          a project by developing a growth strategy, allocating tasks and
          responsibilities among team members, and ensuring high-quality
          communication with clients. I am seeking an opportunity to join an
          innovative team where I can contribute to project development and
          further develop my technical skills and leadership qualities.

            Hello, iâ€™m Alex!
            <br />
            <br />
            I am a Junior JavaScript Developer with 3 years of commercial
            experience, during which I actively worked on various projects,
            including startups and web services, using ReactJS, NextJS, and
            NestJS. I have practical experience with PostgreSQL and AWS, as well
            as integrating payment systems and authorization services. I am
            distinguished by my ability to learn quickly, my skill in solving
            complex problems, and my effectiveness in communicating with both
            the team and clients.
            <br />
            <br />I am noted for my leadership skills, having successfully
            managed a project by developing a growth strategy, allocating tasks
            and responsibilities among team members, and ensuring high-quality
            communication with clients. I am seeking an opportunity to join an
            innovative team where I can contribute to project development and
            further develop my technical skills and leadership qualities.
